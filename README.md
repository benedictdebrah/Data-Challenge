Hey!

We've come up with 3 tasks to check your skills in Excel, Python, SQL and Tableau.
These tasks are aligned with some companies workflows.

You can add the solutions to the tasks in a public repository of your choice

## Scope and Preparation
Namaste Technologies sells cannabis online via their e-commerce Shopify platform, CannMart.
To fulfill their reporting requirements, the Namaste Finance department asks you to create a report so they can process their Q1 financial results.
This exercise is a simplified view, focused on the Shopify orders.

Because extracting the orders from Shopify may take some time to implement, we are providing you with a dump of orders made in Q1. 

**Your goal:** provide a dashboard to the Finance department about the sales results for Q1.


The dump we are providing you is a JSON array that contains orders, following this structure:
* Order ID
* Customer
	* ID
	* Name
	* Email
* Total Order price
* Creation date
* Line items. For each one:
  * ID
  * Product ID
  * Product SKU
  * Product Name
  * Price



## Task 1: Python. Data Manipulation and usage of external APIs
In this task make data ready for further steps

## Task 2: SQL
In this task, we would like you to persist the data obtained from task 1: upload your data to a SQL database of your choice (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL ...).

- Design the right data model for your data
- Create the SQL tables
- Import your data

The outcome of this task is:
- SQL statements to create tables for the data
- A Python script to upload the data (or the one from Task 1, extended)

## Task 3: Reporting
The last task focuses on the results reporting.

Namaste Technologies uses Tableau to create reports for the Finance department.
We are also expecting that you can work with Tableau, so you will be able to maintain our existing dashboards and create new ones.




Thank you!
